# driver-projects

The BD2K driver projects are specific genomic investigations that are being done in collaboration with the UCSC Computational 
Genomics Lab.  These collaborations collectively have two larger goals:
* to motivate CGL software and methods development, ensuring that the software and methods are useful for genomic investigations
* to advance specific genomic investigations through the application of the CGL software and methods.
