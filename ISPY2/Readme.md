# I-SPY 2

ISPY2 is a multi-arm breast cancer clincal trial that uses precision medicine
methods to assign patients to arms of the trial according to genomic data.  
Within each arm, patients are given an experimental compound plus standard
of care (generally chemotherapy), and their outcome is compared to patients
who receive standard of care only.  The trial is organized out of UCSF.

ISPY2 is a clinical trial.  However, at this time (8/31/15), the collaboration
is strictly a research collaboration, with no data affecting patient care/
